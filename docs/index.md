# Alice Modernization Documentation

Alice modernization documentation describes durable behavior, repo-owned
contracts, and contributor workflows for this repository.

## QA and acceptance testing

- [Run Alice desktop outside-in QA](./howto/alice-desktop-outside-in-qa.md) - validate, list, and collect reviewable evidence for user-like desktop acceptance scenarios.
- [Alice desktop outside-in QA tutorial](./tutorials/alice-desktop-outside-in-qa.md) - collect launch evidence and complete a manual workflow evidence checklist.
- [Alice desktop outside-in QA reference](./reference/alice-desktop-outside-in-qa.md) - scenario schema, runner commands, configuration, and evidence artifacts.

## Formal specification lane

The formal-spec lane documents Alice project archive and backup-recovery
behavior as acceptance contracts, a small TLA+ recovery model, and focused JUnit
characterization tests.

- [Formal spec lane concepts](./concepts/formal-spec-lane.md) - Why the lane
  exists and how the artifacts fit together.
- [Use the formal spec artifacts](./howto/use-formal-spec-artifacts.md) - How to
  apply the Gherkin and TLA+ contracts while changing save, load, export, or
  backup recovery behavior.
- [Formal spec contracts reference](./reference/formal-spec-contracts.md) -
  Artifact inventory, archive contracts, recovery model details, configuration,
  and executable validation boundaries.
- [Trace save, load, export, and recovery behavior](./tutorials/trace-save-load-recovery.md) -
  A guided walkthrough from acceptance scenario to model rule to focused test.
